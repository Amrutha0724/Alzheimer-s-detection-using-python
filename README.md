# Alzheimer-s-detection-using-python
This project focuses on the development of a convolutional neural network model for the detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease from brain scan images. Leveraging a dataset with four classes the images were pre-processed by resizing, normalization, and conversion to a consistent format suitable for model training.
